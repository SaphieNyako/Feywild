They rather spend a night listening to song, dancing and flirting then going to combat or mindlessly indulging themselves. They know the upcoming period will be a harsh one, and feel the responsibility of preparing for the end of a cycle."

      "text": "Perhaps the most kind of the Courts, they are still capable of trickery and mischief, but they are more hush-hush about it.  The Autumn Court will protect the Feywild from any evil spirits and will harvest souls who have gone astray. They tend to disguise themselves as past years fallen. To honour them but also to give the lost soul one more good time before passing on to the next stage."
